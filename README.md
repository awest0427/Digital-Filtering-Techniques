# Digital Filtering Techniques
The MATLAB code is to design and analyze a variety of filters that would be applied to complex-baseband data to display the complex filtering. The following 4 standard filter types will be designed: lowpass, highpass, bandpass, and bandstop. 

The main tool used would be the Filter Design and Analysis tool, which allows you to design and analyze multiple filters. Using the Filter Design and Analysis tool(fdatool), in MATLAB, each filter type was designed with a design method and different specifications were set.
